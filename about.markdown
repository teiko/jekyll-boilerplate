## What is it? ##

Jekyll is perfect for putting together very small websites that don't need end user content management or for larger websites that are managed by technical users.

It's as simple to install as <code>gem install jekyll</code> and then forking this project to get a running start.

It can be deployed using Capistrano (an example script is included) or you can even just deploy the generated <code>_site</code> directory to pretty much any Linux server.

In addition to the standard Jekyll functionality I have bundled a few plugins to enable the use of SASS for CSS markup and a plugin to generate a Google-friendly sitemap. Finally I have incorporated many elements of the HTML5 Boilerplate package to provide a solid start for the front-end code.

For the times when you don't want to use a CMS like WordPress or ExpressionEngine but you also don't want a mess of HTML files that you won't be able to easily maintain later on, this is the perfect answer.
